= Endorsement Assertion
:toc: macro

:sectnums:

An _<<_endorsement,endorsement>>_ is a way of indicating approval for specific actions made on content after it has had a _<<C2PA Manifest>>_ attached. (See xref:_generating_an_endorsement[xrefstyle=full].) The *endorsement assertion* is where an _<<_endorsement,endorsement>>_ from the signer of an ingredient _<<C2PA asset>>_ (known here as an _<<_endorser,endorser>>_) is stored. These _<<_endorsement,endorsements>>_ are typically provided (out-of-band of this specification) by ingredient _<<C2PA asset>>_ signers to actors those signers trust to perform the actions listed in the assertion (known here as _<<_endorsee,endorsees>>_). They are used by a validator when assessing whether the actions of the active _<<C2PA Manifest>>_ are “endorsed” or not. (See xref:_validation[xrefstyle=full].)

== Introduction

_This section is non-normative._

=== Scope

IMPORTANT: For purposes of the Community Specification License, the link:https://github.com/creator-assertions/endorsement-assertion/blob/main/scope.md[`scope.md` document] at the root of this project’s GitHub repository is the governing document of this specification’s scope.

=== Overview

_<<_endorsement,Endorsements>>_ are a way of indicating approval of three possible actions (see xref:_permitted_actions[xrefstyle=full]) that could be applied to an _<<C2PA asset>>_ described by a _<<C2PA Manifest>>_ in which the _<<C2PA asset>>_ is used as an ingredient.

_<<_endorsement,Endorsements>>_ endorse the specific actions (described in xref:_permitted_actions[xrefstyle=full]) that MAY be taken by the _<<_endorsee,endorsee>>_, and are therefore valid for _<<_c2pa_manifest,C2PA Manifests>>_ that use only the specified actions. Actions are only endorsed by the signer of that action’s referenced ingredient (known here as the _<<_endorser,endorser>>_); they cannot be endorsed across more than multiple _<<_c2pa_manifest,C2PA Manifests>>_ in the _<<_c2pa_asset,C2PA asset’s>>_ provenance.

=== Use case

As one example, an _<<_endorser,endorser>>_ may want to endorse another party, such as a content-distribution network, who will transcode its _<<C2PA asset>>_ as part of a publication workflow. The _<<_endorser,endorser>>_ creates an _<<_endorsement,endorsement>>_ that identifies the transcoder, and conveys the _<<_endorsement,endorsement>>_ to them in some method that is out-of-band from this specification. When the transcoder creates their _<<C2PA asset>>_ containing the ingredient, they include the _<<_endorsement,endorsement>>_ as an *endorsement assertion,* which lets the _<<C2PA Manifest>>_ consumer know that the actions they performed have been endorsed.

== Terms and definitions

=== Actor

A human or non-human (hardware or software) that is participating in the C2PA ecosystem. For example: a camera (capture device), image editing software, cloud service, or the person using such tools.

NOTE: An organization or group of _actors_ may also be considered an _actor._

=== C2PA asset

A file or stream of data containing _digital content,_ _asset metadata,_ and a _<<C2PA Manifest>>_.

For the purposes of this definition, we will extend the typical definition of “file” to include cloud-native and dynamically-generated data.

IMPORTANT: The definition of “C2PA asset” in this specification differs from the definition of “asset” given in the C2PA technical specification. A “C2PA asset” as defined in _this_ specification MUST contain a _<<C2PA Manifest>>._

=== C2PA Manifest

The set of information about the _provenance_ of a _<<C2PA asset>>_ based on the combination of one or more assertions, a single C2PA claim, and a claim signature.

See link:++https://c2pa.org/specifications/specifications/2.0/specs/C2PA_Specification.html#_manifests++[Section 11, “Manifests,”] of the C2PA technical specification.

=== Endorsee

An _<<_actor,actor>>_ who receives an _<<_endorsement,endorsement>>_ to perform a limited set of actions.

=== Endorsement

A signed credential intended to convey approval from an _<<_endorser,endorser>>_ to perform a limited set of actions on _<<_c2pa_asset,C2PA assets>>_ on their behalf. Endorsements are not constrained to specific _<<_c2pa_asset,C2PA assets>>._

=== Endorser

An _<<_actor,actor>>_ who provides an _<<_endorsement,endorsement>>_ authorizing an _<<_endorsee,endorsee>>_ to perform a limited set of actions on any _<<C2PA asset>>_ signed by the _endorser._

== Generating an endorsement

=== Endorser workflow

Any _<<_actor,actor>>_ MAY choose to become an _<<_endorser,endorser>>_ by producing the following outputs:

* a _<<C2PA asset>>_ and a corresponding _<<C2PA Manifest>>_ (which MAY be embedded in the _<<_c2pa_asset,C2PA asset>>_)
* an _<<_endorsement,endorsement>>,_ as defined in xref:_endorsement_cose_payload[xrefstyle=full]

IMPORTANT: An _<<_endorsement,endorsement>>_ does not convey permission to perform these actions on any specific _<<C2PA asset>>._ Therefore, an _<<_endorsement,endorsement>>_ MUST NOT be included in any _<<C2PA Manifest>>_ or _<<C2PA asset>>_ created by the _<<_endorser,endorser>>._ It SHOULD be provided separately to the _<<_endorsee,endorsee>>._

The relationship among _<<_endorser,endorser>>_, _<<_endorsee,endorsee>>_, and the _<<_endorser,endorser’s>>_ _<<C2PA Manifest>>_ is represented by the following diagram, which is non-normative:

=== Endorsee workflow

An _<<_endorsee,endorsee>>,_ once in possession of a _<<C2PA asset>>_ and an _<<_endorsement,endorsement>>_ signed by the same _<<_actor,actor>>_ that signed the _<<_c2pa_asset,C2PA asset’s>>_ _<<C2PA Manifest>>,_ MAY choose to perform one or more of the actions permitted in xref:_permitted_actions[xrefstyle=full], and describe those actions in a new _<<C2PA Manifest>>._

The _<<_endorseee,endorsee>>_ MAY include the _<<_endorsement,endorsement>>_ by adding an *endorsement assertion* in the new _<<C2PA Manifest>>’s_ assertion store.

Before generating an *endorsement assertion,* the _<<_endorsee,endorsee>>_ MUST ensure that:

* exactly one link:++https://c2pa.org/specifications/specifications/2.0/specs/C2PA_Specification.html#_actions++[`c2pa.actions` assertion] exists in the _<<C2PA Manifest>>,_
* only the actions listed under xref:_permitted_actions[xrefstyle=full] are present in the actions assertion,
* exactly one link:++https://c2pa.org/specifications/specifications/2.0/specs/C2PA_Specification.html#_ingredient++[ingredient assertion] is present in the assertion store, and,
* that ingredient is the one referenced by the actions assertion’s `parameters.ingredient` field.

The *endorsement assertion* MUST have a label of `cawg.endorsement`. The assertion contents MUST be a `COSE_Sign1_Tagged` structure that is created as defined in xref:_endorsement_cose_payload[xrefstyle=full].

There MUST NOT be more than one *endorsement assertion* in any _<<C2PA Manifest>>._

The relationship between the _<<_endorser,endorser’s>>_ _<<C2PA asset>>_ and the _<<_endorsee,endorsee’s>>_ _<<C2PA asset>>_ is illustrated by the following diagram, which is non-normative:

=== Permitted actions

The link:++https://c2pa.org/specifications/specifications/2.0/specs/C2PA_Specification.html#_actions++[`c2pa.actions` assertion] in a _<<C2PA Manifest>>_ containing an *endorsement assertion* MAY contain any of the following action codes:

* `c2pa.published`
* `c2pa.transcoded`
* `c2pa.repackaged`

The actions assertion MUST NOT contain any other action codes.

=== Endorsement COSE payload

_<<_endorsement,Endorsements>>_ are COSE objects (see link:++https://c2pa.org/specifications/specifications/2.0/specs/C2PA_Specification.html#_digital_signatures++[Section 13.2, “Digital Signatures,” of the C2PA 2.0 Technical Specification]), where the COSE payload is an “endorsement target” data structure encoded as CBOR, as shown below. The `endorseeCredential` field is an object with a single field, labelled according to the type of credential used to sign the _<<_endorsement,endorsement>>._ The label of this field indicates to validators the type of the credential present, so that they know how to decode, parse and validate the credential correctly. The following table details the format of each of the currently specified credential types:

==== Endorsement credential types

[col="2,1,4,4"]
|===
|Credential name |CBOR label |Value type |Compares To

|Reserved
|0

|X.509 SubjectPublicKeyInfo
|1
|A https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5280#section-4.1[DER-encoded ASN.1 SubjectPublicKeyInfo] structure (as a CBOR `bstr`), from the _endorsee’s_ X.509 certificate that will be used for signing the claims of _<<_c2pa_asset,C2PA assets>>_ that this _<<_endorsement,endorsement>>_ is expected to be used with.
|The value of the credential shall be compared (bitwise identical) to the SubjectPublicKeyInfo structure of the certificate located in the `x5chain` or `33` (integer) COSE header of the active _<<C2PA Manifest>>_ claim signature. (See link:++https://c2pa.org/specifications/specifications/2.0/specs/C2PA_Specification.html#x509_certificates++[Section 14.6, “X.509 Certificates,” of the C2PA 2.0 Technical Specification].)
|===

_<<_endorser,Endorsers>>_ SHALL place the credential of the signer they are endorsing (the _<<_endorsee,endorsee>>_) and its type in the `endorseeCredential`. To limit the length of time that an _<<_endorser,endorser>>_ is lending their _<<_endorsement,endorsement>>_ to the _<<_endorsee,endorsee>>,_ the `notValidBefore` and `notValidAfter` fields MUST contain ISO 8601 date times.

The schema for the endorsement target type is defined by the `endorsement-target-map` rule in the following https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8610[CDDL Definition]:

[source,cddl]
----
include::partial$schemas/cddl/endorsement-target.cddl[]
----

An example endorsement target is shown below:

[source,json]
----
include::partial$schemas/cddl/examples/endorsement-target.cbordiag[]
----

To sign an _<<_endorsement,endorsement>>,_ follow the procedure specified in link:++https://c2pa.org/specifications/specifications/2.0/specs/C2PA_Specification.html#_digital_signatures++[Section 13.2, “Digital Signatures,” of the C2PA 2.0 Technical Specification], using the serialised CBOR `endorsement-target` object as the contents of the payload field. An _<<_endorser,endorser>>_ SHALL NOT include a `x5chain` header and value, as _<<_endorsement,endorsements>>_ are validated in the context of their use as an ingredient, and therefore use the signing credential of that ingredient _<<C2PA Manifest>>._ (See xref:_validation[xrefstyle=full].)

The serialized `COSE_Sign1_Tagged` structure resulting from the digital signature procedure is the _<<_endorsement,endorsement>>_ that MAY be conveyed to the _<<_endorsee,endorsee>>_ identified in the `endorsement-target`, but the process for conveying it is out of scope of this specification.

== Validation

Validation of an *endorsement assertion* SHALL only be attempted if the active _<<C2PA Manifest>>_ first meets a number of conditions:

* There is exactly one link:++https://c2pa.org/specifications/specifications/2.0/specs/C2PA_Specification.html#_actions++[actions assertion] present in the assertion store.
* There is exactly one link:++https://c2pa.org/specifications/specifications/2.0/specs/C2PA_Specification.html#_ingredient++[ingredient assertion].
* There is exactly one *endorsement assertion.*

For each `action` object in the link:++https://c2pa.org/specifications/specifications/2.0/specs/C2PA_Specification.html#_actions++[actions assertion]:

. Check that the `action` field is set to `c2pa.published`, `c2pa.transcoded`, or `c2pa.repackaged`. If any other action is present, fail the *endorsement assertion* validation process for this _<<C2PA Manifest>>_ and do not proceed with further validation.
. Check the `ingredient` field that is a member of the `parameters` object for the presence of a JUMBF URI. If the JUMBF URI is not present, or cannot be resolved to the related ingredient assertion, fail the *endorsement assertion* validation process for this _<<C2PA Manifest>>_ and do not proceed with further validation.
. Follow the JUMBF URI link in the `ingredient` field to the ingredient assertion. Check that the URI link resolves to the single ingredient assertion in the active _<<C2PA Manifest>>._ If it does not, fail the *endorsement assertion* validation process for this _<<C2PA Manifest>>_ and do not proceed with further validation. Check that the `relationship` field is `parentOf`. If it is not, fail the *endorsement assertion* validation process for this _<<C2PA Manifest>>_ and do not proceed with further validation.
. Check the `c2pa_manifest` field in the ingredient assertion for the presence of a hashed URI. If the hashed URI is not present, or cannot be resolved to a _<<C2PA Manifest>>,_ fail the *endorsement assertion* validation process for this _<<C2PA Manifest>>_ and do not proceed with further validation.
. Follow the JUMBF URI link in the `c2pa_manifest` field to the ingredient’s _<<C2PA Manifest>>._ Ensure that this _ingredient_ _<<C2PA Manifest>>_ has been validated according to link:++https://c2pa.org/specifications/specifications/2.0/specs/C2PA_Specification.html#_recursively_validating_integrity_of_ingredients++[Section 15.8, “Recursively validating integrity of ingredients,” of the C2PA 2.0 Technical Specification], but do not skip the establishing of signer credential trust. If it does not validate, fail the *endorsement assertion* validation process for this _<<C2PA Manifest>>_ and do not proceed with further validation.
. Validate the endorsement as described in link:++https://c2pa.org/specifications/specifications/2.0/specs/C2PA_Specification.html#_recursively_validating_integrity_of_ingredients++[Section 15.4, “Validate the signature,” of the C2PA Technical Specification], using the credential of the ingredient _<<C2PA Manifest>>_ signer. If a signing credential is present in the endorsement’s signature’s headers, it shall not be used for validation. If validation fails, fail the *endorsement assertion* validation process for this _<<C2PA Manifest>>_ and do not proceed with further validation.
. Validate the `endorsement-target` payload itself, following the steps below:
.. Compare the `endorseeCredential` to the credential of the active _<<C2PA Manifest>>_ signer, according to the table found in xref:_endorsement_credential_types[xrefstyle=full]. If the comparison fails, fail the *endorsement assertion* validation process for this _<<C2PA Manifest>>_ and do not proceed with further validation.
.. If the active _<<C2PA Manifest>>_ is timestamped, then the _time-stamp_ must fall within the endorsement’s validity time range. If it does not, fail the *endorsement assertion* validation process for this _<<C2PA Manifest>>_ and do not proceed with further validation.
.. If the active _<<C2PA Manifest>>_ is not timestamped, then the _time of validation_ must fall within the endorsement’s validity time range. If it does not, fail the *endorsement assertion* validation process for this _<<C2PA Manifest>>_ and do not proceed with further validation.

If all steps above have been completed without failure, the *endorsement assertion* SHOULD be considered valid.
