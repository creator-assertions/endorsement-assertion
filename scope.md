# Scope

This document outlines the scope of work undertaken by the Creator Assertions Working Group’s Endorsement Assertion project.

## Objectives

The objective of this project is to refresh and update the endorsement assertion specification.

Endorsements are a way of indicating approval of three possible actions as defined in the [C2PA Technical Specification](https://c2pa.org/specifications/specifications/2.0/specs/C2PA_Specification.html#_actions), `c2pa.published`, `c2pa.transcoded`, and `c2pa.repackaged`, that could be applied to an asset in a C2PA manifest in which the asset is used as an ingredient.

This assertion was removed in the C2PA 2.0 specification. This project will re-publish that specification as a product of the Creator Assertions Working Group.

## Membership and joining

This specification is being developed under the [Community Specification 1.0 License](https://github.com/CommunitySpecification/1.0/1._Community_Specification_License-v1.md). Contributors to this specification must adhere to the license, as outlined in the repository’s [license file](/license.md) file.

## Deliverables

This Working Group shall produce a version 1.0 of an endorsement assertion specification which shall reflect the consensus of the members at that time. The Working Group may produce subsequent versions of the specification.

## Meeting schedule and notes

See [CAWG: Meeting schedule](https://creator-assertions.github.io/#_meeting_schedule) for meeting schedule and notes from previous meetings.

## Dependencies

The endorsement assertion specification must align with the C2PA Technical Specification that is current as of the time of publication. The specification may also describe compatibility with previous versions of the C2PA Technical Specification.

## About this document

Any changes of Scope are not retroactive.
